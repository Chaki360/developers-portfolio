            <h3>La Masia academy carrying FC Barcelona </h3>
            <p>Nico González and Pablo Páez Gaviria. Or as they are better known, Nico and Gavi. Two young midfielders
                who
                are destined to make big names for themselves at Camp Nou are the latest La Masía products to have
                impressed
                Ronald Koeman enough to play for the first team.Both Nico and Gavi were already making huge impressions
                as
                youth players. Nico arrived from Montañeros when he was just 11 and has made spectacular progress
                through
                the ranks, eventually making his Barça B debut at the age of 17 in the final game of the 2018/19 season.
                It
                was in the 2020/21 season when he truly made his breakthrough, being one of the key reasons for the
                reserves’ promotion to Primera RFEF.</p>
