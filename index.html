            <h3>La Masia academy carrying FC Barcelona </h3>
            <p>Nico González and Pablo Páez Gaviria. Or as they are better known, Nico and Gavi. Two young
                midfielders
                who
                are destined to make big names for themselves at Camp Nou are the latest La Masía products to have
                impressed
                Ronald Koeman enough to play for the first team.Both Nico and Gavi were already making huge
                impressions
                as
                youth players. Nico arrived from Montañeros when he was just 11 and has made spectacular progress
                through
                the ranks, eventually making his Barça B debut at the age of 17 in the final game of the 2018/19
                season.
                It
                was in the 2020/21 season when he truly made his breakthrough, being one of the key reasons for the
                reserves’ promotion to Primera RFEF.</p>

        <h1>New Era of FC Barcelona</h1>
        <h2>Ferran Torres joins FC Barcelona from Man City</h2>
        <p>The 21-year-old, who spent 16 months at the Etihad Stadium, scored 16 goals in 43 appearances for City in all
            competitions and he departs a Premier League and Carabao Cup winner, having helped the Club lift both
            trophies in his debut 2020-21 campaign.This season, his progress was curtailed by a metatarsal injury
            suffered whilst on international duty, which has kept him out since OctoberFrom there his rise was meteoric.
            In what seems like a flick of an eye he had advanced from all the way to the Valencia first team and made
            his Liga debut on 16 December 2017 against Eibar, in doing so becoming the first player born this century to
            appear in the competition. But he had already made his official debut a few days earlier on November 30 in a
            Copa del Rey game against Zaragoza. </p>

            <H2>Signing of Ansu Fati's contract</H2>
            <h3 class="orange-color">2021-2027 | Barcelona's main striker</h3>
            <p>Ansu Fati has signed a new five-and-a-half year contract at Barcelona which includes a €1 billion
                (£846m/$1.16bn) release clause, the Catalan club confirmed on Wednesday. The 18-year-old has agreed to
                remain at Camp Nou through to 2027, bringing to an end the recent speculation over his future.Having
                initially broken into the first-team aged 16 towards the end of 2019, Fati has recently returned from a
                knee
                injury that forced him to miss most of last season and is already playing a starring role once more. He
                has
                even been assigned Lionel Messi’s old number 10 shirt.</p>

            <h2>Pedri's contract extension</h2>
            <h3 class="orange-color">2020-2026 | Best young midfielders </h3>
            <p>Pedri officially became an FC Barcelona player on 20 August 2020. The young Barca player was only 17
                years
                old when he was presented in Auditori 1899 and the year he turned 18 proved to be one to remember.
                Thanks to
                his collective vision for the game, age proved no barrier to Pedri becoming a starter in midfield.The
                young
                Barça player also became the second youngest footballer to play in 50 official matches behind Bojan
                Krkic.
                Pedri scored his first goal for Barça in a 5-2 win over Real Betis. Scoring the final goal of the match
                made
                him the fourth youngest player in the Club's history to score in La Liga, behind Ansu Fati, Bojan Krkic
                and
                Leo Messi.</p>
