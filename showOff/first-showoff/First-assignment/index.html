            <P>Nothing has come easy for Xavi and Barcelona this season.Whole 2021-22 season is totally going with
                so
                much obstacles.So we fans are hoping year 2022 will be better than the last year. Still there will
                be
                difficult time on and off the pitch but slowly & steadily FCB will make their progress.

                    <h2>Mission</h2>
                    <p>Manager Xavi’s biggest mission for 2022 is to Make Barcelona Brave Again. This very season(
                        2021-22)
                        Barcelona having very tough time since It's started.Losing back to back matches in the UCL
                        knocked
                        them
                        out
                        of the tournament from the group stage for the first time in a span of time two decades.So
                        gaining
                        confidence will be the main mission for Barcelona this year.

                    <h2>Vission</h2>
                    <p>Barcelona's Vission for this year is pretty clear they are wanting to sign some of the big names
                        in
                        the
                        upcoming summer transfer window. Recently they have signed another promising young player Ferran
                        Torres
                        from Manchester City. So their vission is to sign as many good players they can in this year.

                        single
                        Trophy in this year.Weather It's Copa Del Rey, UEFA EUROPA LEAGUE, Spanish Super Cup or Even
                        Laliga's
                        League title.So that's what they are thinking at the moment and that's their goal for this year
